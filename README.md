## To run this shell script:

1. Download it, and in your terminal type: ```chmod +x my-shell-script.sh``` This makes the file executable (i.e., you can now run it)
	+ An equivalent command is ```chmod 755 my-shell-script.sh```. This gives the script read, write, and execute permissions to the user (you!), and read and execute permissions to your group and others.
2. To actually run the script, in your terminal type: ```./my-shell-script.sh```
3. To zip the file for submission, type ```zip my-zipped-filename.zip my-shell-script.sh``` (Note: you may need to install zip depending on your OS)
